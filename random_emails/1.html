    <h1>Dear Dr. Chaudhuri,</h1>
    <p>
      I happen to have thoroughly enjoyed this course conducted by you. No, it's not an email to butter you up for extra marks or getting extra negatives as I leave a bad review (though I hope it won't affect my already non-existent marks).
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to understand the concept of thermodynamics from a more core analytical perspective in terms of mathematical fundamentals and not the chemical intuition or the statistical one, why? because it would give me another dimension of understanding to play with. I went ahead and went with it along with the chemical intuitions constantly in flow due to your classes...(yes, I did miss one week class). But after a while I understood that I was lagging behind in solving problems for the course, and then I did try to do and solve problems but somewhere I guess, I still stayed behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the end after catching up I got a heuristic view on the later part of the course as there was no more book or pure mathematical intuition to guide me, but then after you did the "geometric average of the activity coefficients" something clicked (mentioned in the assignment... only the concepts), I got a new view to understand a lot of the chemical potentials as a geometric progression (not going into details here). But soon I shall be writing down all of my views on my github at <a href="https://github.com/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal/Thermodynamics-Open-Source" target="_blank">https://github.com/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal/Thermodynamics-Open-Source</a> ....
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, as most of the things I said until now were more of a feel good but just one thing I really felt lacking was the absence of doing/conducting numericals/practice questions for the midsem/endsem exams. Other than that I believe everything was very well done. A bit more of Catellan, would have been better but it's fine as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all I have to say. I don't expect any reply from you on this email. I just hope that you shall read it once along with the assignment and do the necessary grading.
    </p>
    <p>Thanking you.</p>
